			<h1>About Me</h1>
			
			<p>I am a web developer who is interested in human computer interaction. I love the creativity and visual feedback from developing front end web software. But that is not all I can do with a computer.
			I have always found myself fixing people's computers, whether it was my own at a young age after messing around with the family computer, or as a defacto IT guy at a real estate firm I was working at. Knowing me has its perks. As for my personality, I am endlessly curious.
			I am huge a fan of Linux and open source software. Recently, I have been working a lot with jQuery, Sass, HTML5 and regular ol' JavaScript but if you take a look at my work, I am pretty open to many languages.
			</p>
			
			<p>Why not take a look at my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/chocolatechimpcookie"><button class="white_button btn"> CodeAcademy</button></a>  profile?</p>
			<p>Or maybe the <a href="./hardware.html"><button class="white_button btn"> hardware</button></a> I am working with.</p>

					<h2>Geotagger</h2>
			<p class="project_description">This is the largest project I have worked on. It is a citizen science project. It uses AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass and works with a seperate
			API backend. The general idea is to be able to coordinate citizen science work between scientists and citizens in a social networking-like environment.
			One can make comments, register and do much more in an asynchronous fashion. This means that it loads new information and sends information without reloading the page. It is mobile friendly.
			Included in pictures is a presentation slideshow for the project.

			<h2>JayNote</h2>
			<p class="project_description">This is an Android app that I made with two other project mates.
			It was written in Java and the libraries provided
			by Google. I took care of much of the UI design, UI implementation, localization into Spanish,
			the initial concept and the ideas for logos. It
			allows people to record notes on different animals and plants. They can make "Sightings" which
			record a sighting of an organism. One can also record audio and pictures in this Sighting.
			One can also use the app as a notes app. There's also a external links page and a tips page for
			survival tips.
			The link to the "Pictures" button also holds a presentation slideshow which goes into more detail.

			<h2>HealthSite</h2>
			<p class="project_description">This is a website that I made with two other project members. The idea behind it was to create a website
			to inform people on how to act during a medical emergency as well as to inform them of common injuries. It also uses Bootstrap and is
			mobile ready. The pictures include a presentation file with some background information. There is also a quizzes section to quiz
			guests on their knowledge.

	<!--		<p class="project_description">-->
	<!--			I did this for a language processing class. I split the work with one other team member. I wrote the webpage and JavaScript for it as well as-->
	<!--			made an archive of political text to create a set of conditions on. My teammate processed this this text. The basic idea is that the project-->
	<!--			treated political ideology as a two axis compass; like a cartesian chart. This gives it 4 quadrants. Data was found on all 4 quadrants.-->
	<!--			The data was then compared quadrant by quadrant as well as split on either axis. Then the user would upload a text file with speeches from a figure.-->
				<!--The application would use the conditions in combination with word count to make a few guesses on the author's political orientation.
				<!--Unfortunately this application does not work entirely as intended. The application is biased towards one quadrant. To fix it, one would need to fix the condition sets and figure out			-->
				<!--the proportions needed to attain significant data from those conditions and the input supplied by the user.-->

			<h2>Abstract Automatica</h2>
			<p class="project_description">This project uses a Scribbler robot. I wrote this program in Python. It draws abstract shapes and makes color theory based decisions for the user. The idea was that
			it can draw different shapes as well as draw some more abstract patterns based on fractals. There was also the idea of playing with fractal
			algorithms to get more unpredictable results. I wanted to imitate more abstract art. The robot can detect its surroundings with sensors to keep itself in the area
			that it is working in.</p>

			<h2>Conference Website</h2>
			<p class="project_description">This is my first website. The UI is a little rough around the edges as well as the structure, but it demonstrates that I can work in PHP.
			One can submit documents, register, etc. There is also an admin role which lets you modify the data in the SQL database.
			The UI menu adjusts to logins. The demo included demonstrates the login and admin capabilities as well as how the menu changes when the user logs in.
